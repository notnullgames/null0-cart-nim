# null0-cart-nim
A template project for making a null0 cart in nim

You will need `zip` command-line program in your path, but there is a task to build & zip up the cart:

```
nimble cart
```

See [cart.nimble](cart.nimble) if you need to add to/modify the command.


If that doesn;t work for you, or just need the main.wasm file:

```
nimble build
```
